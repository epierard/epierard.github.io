<p align="justify"> I'm a <a href="https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/graduate/research/epierard.html"> PhD student at University of Oxford</a> studying systems transitions, with a focus on fossil fuels to renewable energy in oil majors.

<!--<p align="justify"> During my career, I have worked on research projects related to Atmospheric Physics and Physical Oceanography that involved numerical simulations, data processing and observational fieldwork.</p>  />-->

## Short Bio
Before my PhD studies I held positions in both energy and climate change policy. As part of my academic training, I have also joined research assistant positions in water finance at Oxford, and a project between Princeton and Oxford on oil decarbonisation strategies, as well as TA sessions at the Sa√Ød Business School.

I hold a MSc in Environmental Governance from Oxford University and a B.A. in Political Science from El Colegio de Mexico. I am currently at the mid-stage of my PhD. </p>

## My Research
I study how sustainable transitions happen and how major economic actors can be part or obstructs for them, as well as the role that government regulation and policy has has to play. My hunch is that the way they adopt climate change technologies relate to their past technology experiences with regards to government subsidies and regulation, and their learnt ability to resist.
In my research I am looking at European oil major companies' involvement and retention of renewable energy technologies over the last 20 years. </p>

<p align="justify"> I am also interested in sustainable food transitions and system behaviour change, as well as the political processes by which 'green' initiatives and technologies are defined and accepted.
